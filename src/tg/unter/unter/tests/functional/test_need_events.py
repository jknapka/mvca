'''
Test that need_events can be matched up with volunteers correctly.

NOTE 1: test fixtures (that is, the setUp() and tearDown() methods
of a test case) MUST perform manual transaction management via
the transaction module, eg

try:
    # Manipulate the model via model.DBSession
except:
    transaction.abort()
else:
    transaction.commit()

Failure to do this will cause SQLAlchemy to raise a
"Transaction is closed" error.

NOTE 2: much of this code is testing units of functionality outside the
TG framework's request-handling mechanism. That is why some of the
test methods (as opposed to the fixture methods mentioned above) must
also perform manual transaction management module - there is no application
stack to take care of that for us. In cases where we make an HTTP
request (via app.get() or similar), we allow the app stack to manage
transaction state.

    Story:
      - Carla creates a need event for a family needing
        a ride to the airport on Sunday morning at 10:00 AM, which
        will take about 1 hour.
      - Vincent, Veronica, and Velma are available at that time.
        However, Vincent has already committed to drive two
        individuals to the bus station at 10:15. 
      - Veronica and Velma have not committed to any events that
        overlap the interval from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on Sunday 
        morning, so they should receive alerts. 
      - Alerts are sent via email, and via text (if the volunteer
        has indicated text alert preference).
      - Volunteer phone numbers are visible on the event
        page to logged-in coordinators, so they can make confirmation
        phone calls to volunteers.
      - Coordinator phone numbers are visible to volunteers for
        the events to which they have committed. Only the phone
        numbers for the coordinators who created those events
        are visible to volunteers, and only to the volunteers
        who commit to the events.
